Food:
Food is a fundamental requirement, containing nutrients essential for body tissue growth, repair, and maintenance. These nutrients provide energy for our bodies, measured in calories. The recommended daily caloric intake for children aged 11-14 ranges from 1,600 to 2,600 calories, with sedentary girls needing the least and active boys needing the most. Adults need between 1,800 and 3,000 calories.

Famine:
Famine is a widespread issue where people lack access to food due to natural disasters, human events, or warfare. Developed countries have mostly eliminated famine, but African countries are most common. In 2011, Somalia experienced a widespread famine resulting in over 250,000 deaths. Preventing famine involves supporting humanitarian relief efforts and funding programs to help local communities survive drought and other food scarcity causes.


Hunger and War:
The United Nations Security Council has criticized the use of food insecurity and starvation as a war tactic, urging all parties to maintain food stocks, farms, markets, and distribution mechanisms. The resolution aims to address the rising number of hungry and malnourished people worldwide, which has been declining for at least two decades but began increasing after 2015. Armed conflict can cause food shortages, disrupt economic activities, and even precipitate violent political conflict.


Droughts:
Droughts are periods of below-normal precipitation, causing soil moisture, groundwater, crop damage, and water shortages. They are the second-most costly weather events after hurricanes. Droughts affect people by reducing access to clean drinking water and crop growth. National Geographic Emerging Explorer Alexandra Cousteau's initiative, Blue Legacy, aims to raise awareness about water issues and protect Earth's freshwater resources.


Migrants :
The UN established the Sustainable Development Goals in 2012 to tackle environmental, political, and economic issues. The UN aims to achieve 17 SDGs by 2030, with Zero Hunger as the second SDG. The initiative aims to end hunger by 2030, ensure nutritious food availability, end malnutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture.
